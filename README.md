# Studying Tracker Program

This program keeps track of how long you have studied this week.
You will be presented with a window asking for your semester start date and how many weeks the semester is:

If you have inputted any invalid data an error box will be shown just below the invalid input.
When all the inputted data is deemed to be valid, the submit button will be able to be pressed.

The Module window has 3 parts to it.
* On the left is a list displaying information about added modules as well as how many hours you have studied and how many are left.
* On the top right is the add module section, here you can add new modules.
* On the bottom right is a combo box where you can select an added module and below that is a text box where you can add the hours you studied today.

Like the previous window, if you enter any invalid options an error box will be shown under the invalid input.
